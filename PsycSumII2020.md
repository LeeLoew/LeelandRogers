<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Your own specific thoughts on the instructor for this course are very important. Please use this space to review the instructor. Write as little or as much as you like (up to 4000 characters). Your input is extremely valuable.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The instructor for this class did a really good job with extensively and professionally explaining the course materials. He paid great attention to the students needs, feedback and issues. I enjoyed completing and participating in the class activities. I'd like to say thank you to the professor for the effort and time put into the constructive and unique delivery of the lectures, quizzes, exams and bonus contents. It was all really helpful and a great resource.</span><br />I really liked how our professor was easy to communicate and always willing to help students.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">This instructor was extremely understanding of the fact that we were online and that other situations came up in student's lives during this time and he was flexible to accomodate our needs to make this class as little stressful as possible.</span><br />good<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really appreciate the fact that Lee has made personal comments in his lectures about gender and sexual identity that sort of disagree with the text because it is not as up to date. Lee has great insight when responding to my exams and even shows he has thoroughly read what I have written by mentioning it in his videos. He has also made sure to even implement suggestions students have made and to make a point of telling us what he is changing. Because of my busy personal life Lee has been great with giving me time once on an assignment when I needed it. I feel like I have learned a lot this past month and would definitely take another class with him.</span><br />Professor Rogers was very considerate and thoughtful in his approach to teaching. I especially enjoyed his anecdotes and personal thoughts on the textbook material.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I found the professor very professional and nice at the same time. The lectures were very clear and organized. I enjoyed this class a lot.</span><br />n/a<br /><span style="color: #000000;">good instructor, special assignment which let me think more about the topic</span><br />The lecturer's content is clear and organized. And easy to understand.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">n/a</span><br />I took 4 classes this summer, and this one was by far my favorite! Easy to keep up with and information is presented very clearly.<br />out of all of my online classes, I really enjoyed this class and professor the most. He was always there for help, and the lecture videos were both in depth but short. I feel as if he helped us learn even more by the frequent reflections and discussion posts. I felt as if the exams were manageable and would love to take another class with this professor in the future.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Great class great instructor. Would take again</span><br />The professor is very good.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think that instructor Leeland Rogers is an extremely great teacher. He cares for individual needs and always made the class know that we can be accommodated for almost anything. The class wasn't too hard but also wasn't extremely easy. Something that I also really enjoyed was the fact that reflections were allowed to be "sloppy" and we could just free write. I think this helps with creativity and doesn't make the students stress about grammatic errors, which in most classes are important. The individual feedback we got on each exam was great and showed that he cared. I also never had a professor give feedback on exams and I am about to be a senior, so I found it very generous. Also, the fact that the To-do list was made for us and listed out each day made completing all the work much easier. It was an extra step instructor Leeland Rogers did to help us, even though he didnt have to. All in all, I really enjoyed this class and I would love to take another class with him.</span><br />Lee was my favorite professor I've had to date and I wish I could have met him in person and I would be curious to see how he'd structure an in-person class. Lee was very engaging and made it so none of the work was overwhelming. I really enjoyed taking his course and I don't think I would have gotten as much from an online psych course if it was with anyone less engaging and less interested in the material<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I thought the instructor was very knowledgeable about the course ans should continue teaching this course.</span><br />Lee was very clear in his teaching and very understanding/flexible with our individual circumstances. The discussions he created were very engaging while being meaningful. Definitely enjoyed learning process in this course.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">The instructor came across as approachable and flexible, but not to the point where I felt that I could slack off. I think he did a great job switching to an online course and if I take a psych class again I would look for him.</span><br />I would definitely take his class again, as it was structured really well. Was not overwhelming. He was more than willing to listen to the student&iquest;s voice and opinions.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Has a very warm and welcoming attitude and is good for the freshmen who are just starting their college career.</span><br />I liked this class, and the instructor knew what he was talking about. I think the class was very inclusive and the instructor was willing to correct the book when it gave out of date information.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">He was always presentable and videos. Responded quickly to emails. I also enjoyed the music in the background of the videos as it made video lectures easy to listen to.</span><br />nothing<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Everything is fine.</span><br />AMAZING!! He should be teaching Intro to Psych much more often. He keeps it lively, manageable and important. He is a great professor and what he is teaching comes across well!! He's easy to talk to, understand and learn from. Great class to end my time at Delaware with.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">This instructor is extremely knowledgeable about course materials and always presents lecture material in a fun and interesting way.</span><br />very good<br /><span style="color: #000000;">he is really nice</span><br />I truly enjoyed this class. I found Professor Lee tone caring, thoughtful, and considerate. He made this class manageable and easy to follow. The goals of each week were extremely clear and I never felt that the assignments were confusing. All around great class and would recommend to other students<br /><span style="color: #000000;">It&iquest;s a great class, I enjoy the learning experience from this class.</span><br />passionate and patient</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Describe a concrete positive suggestion for how instruction can be improved. For example, something a different instructor does that works well.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My class was successful and good. Hence, I have no suggestions. Thank you!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">everything was great! I do not have any suggestions</span><br />This professor provides personalized feedback in individually recorded videos, which really makes me feel like he cares about his students. He is also <span style="color: #000000;">very prompt about answering questions via email.</span><br />The professor is very responsible for giving feedback.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">IF we were in person we would have more peer to peer discussions and that is useful especially for this kind of class where you have to talk about your ideas with each other.</span><br />I honestly am very happy with this professor so I can't come up with anything.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">n/a</span><br />nothing<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I like this class very much, I think this class is very interesting, the instructor is also very nice</span><br />Loved Prof. Leeland<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Can't think of anything! Everything you did was spot on!</span><br />I honestly thought that this course was set up perfect. Due to the nature of online class, I understand why it was one lecture a day, but sometimes wished I could do more than one lecture in one day!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Nothing. Awesome work</span><br />N/A<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I enjoyed every aspect of the class</span><br />I don't have much to add. I think the course instruction was among the best I've experienced at UD<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Professor was great so nothing is needed to do better at the moment</span><br />-<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Honestly the only thing I can think of would be to make the syllabus reflect which section of the textbook go with the week so that students can choose when they want to read the textbook.</span><br />He does his best to make sure each student is included and feels welcome. He is a great professor<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Nothing to add.</span><br />N/A<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Some videos could have been shorter but overall the class had a consistent flow to it.</span><br />nope<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Everything is excellent.</span><br />It works extremely well that he sections the course into different chunks and weeks and tests on those rather than as cumulative information. I also think it works well that he teaches interesting, important information such as what damage to certain parts of the brain can do. It's beneficial to learn and know and kept me intriuged.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">i think everything is good</span><br />nope<br /><span style="color: #000000;">honestly found this to be the best online class I have taken and feel that this class is being held to the best of its ability</span><br />Maybe more interaction with students would be better.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">it's overall quite good now</span></span></p>
