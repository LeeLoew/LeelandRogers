<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Your own specific thoughts on the instructor for this course are very important. Please use this space to review the instructor. Write as little or as much as you like (up to 4000 characters). Your input is extremely valuable.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I really enjoyed this class and Professor Rogers. He is very kind and personable and you can tell he has respect for all his students. He was very understanding of his students and the difficulties all are facing during this time of Covid and online learning. He was very flexible and the material was very interesting. Loved this class!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really enjoyed the way he taught. It made learning easy and fun. And whenever I had an issue with something not working, he was very understanding and helped me out.</span><br />I thought the structure of the class made it simple for students to understand the assignments. I liked the set up of thr quizzes in between the lectures. The instructor was very nice and fair<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really enjoy taking his class and think he's great at explaining tough material!</span><br />I thought he was very enthusiastic about teaching and it made what he was saying interesting to listen to compared to professors who I've had in the past who don't seem like they care. He was very understanding of any problems I had during the course because I had two surgeries during that time so he was very flexible.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">An amazing professor!</span><br />One of my favorite courses! Professor (Leeland) Rogers made the class enjoyable, thought-provoking, and flexible - helped me tremendously both for furthering my studies and accommodating the schedule of a part-time job I have to help with living expenses. I highly recommend his course. His fast communication, clear lectures, and emphasis on deadlines kept me alert and engaged throughout the winter session. Great class!!!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Given the current circumstances, the online course was structured in a way that was very accommodating to all student needs. </span>Leeland Rogers has shown a clear and genuine interest in ensuring that students who put effort in succeed, and a continuous willingness to assist students at all points throughout the course. Personally, I believe my instructor has achieved what should be the standard for asynchronous 5-week courses, and has gone above and beyond for his students.<br /><strong>Great teacher!</strong><br />I am so happy that I got the chance to be part of Professor Rogers's class. The class is organized in a way that made it helpful and easier for me to learn. The assignments were not too hard and not too easy, I was able to watch the lecture and take a quiz at the same which I believed motivated me to stay focused as I'm learning and trying to retain the information I'm acquiring through the video lectures.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">He came across very kind and thoughtful during the lectures, and was very sure to point out the outdated research.</span><br />I really like the instructor. He's a very nice guy that really tries to help us with whatever we need. He's super flexible and that's so refreshing to have an instructor that is understanding of the students' situation.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really liked Professor Rogers and this course. He was accommodating, friendly and did not make his class too easy or too difficult. I enjoyed learning from him over a 5 week period and all of his assignments were creative and engaging. Overall, this has been one of my favorite classes, and a large part of that is because of Professor Rogers.</span><br />Professor Rogers was very helpful throughout the winter session in all ways. The course was well structured and it was clear that a great deal of effort was put into preparation. The textbook lined up really well with the lecture material and the supplied bonus information proved not only to be informative, but super interesting as well.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Professor Rogers was one of the best professors I have had so far at the University of Delaware. He was so organized when presenting new material to the class, and was hands down one of the most understanding professors I have ever encountered. I never felt stressed or overwhelmed because I knew Professor Rogers was making equal efforts on his part to maintain a manageable and healthy class environment. His compassion and genuine caring nature shone through throughout the entirety of this class.</span><br />The instructor was super understanding of schedules and needs of students. The lectures were short which was very relieving and tests covered the same material covered in class. I loved this class with this professor, and I would definitely take a class with him again.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">He did an amazing job with being helpful and listening to our feedback.</span><br />I appreciated how open Professor Rogers was to suggestions. I appreciated the feeling of being listened to and having our suggestions being taken into account seriously. He made it very clear to us that we could always voice our concerns and that he would try to accommodate and assist us should we also need any additional time on assignments.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">N/A</span><br />The instructor was very helpful and created a fun learning experience that challenged my thought. I was very pleased with this class<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Lee was great. I had so many technical difficulties and he was always willing to work with me and help me however he could. I also loved how he made the comfort of his students the priority in class. Giving an option for feedback at the end of each exam for extra credit made it feel like my concerns were important. I also loved to format of the course, i think it really enhanced my learning.</span><br />Professor Rogers worked with the students to make our daily lectures and tasks a routine that was clear, concise, accessible and informative.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I was planning to withdraw from this course if our instructor is not professor Leeland L Rogers.</span><br />The instructor was very enthusiastic about the material he taught. He was also very receptive of feedback and made sure that the students all felt like they mattered. I really liked the video feedback for exams and the fact that it really seemed like he was invested in each student's individual success.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think he did very well. I like the way he set up his course and he was also very supportive of our work. He made sure to tell us good job on each exam, which is very nice considering the size of this course.</span><br />Professor Rogers gives very clear instruction on what information we need to know, while grading us very fairly.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">The instructor was very excellent in guiding through this course. He was very personable, and always made sure that we were not too stressed out. He also provided feedback for every exam, and offered a way on every exam for us to provide our feedback.</span><br />they were very interested in teaching the material and made assignments easy and doable<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think Professor Rogers was an excellent professor, especially for this course. He made the information simple and easy to get through, while also providing additional resources for me to go even further with my learning. The exams were straight forward and every day of class I always knew exactly what to do. He always gave us a list of what we needed to complete that day which is something I had never experienced in college before, but was incredibly beneficial to my success in the class. He seems very organized and willing to help. Very enjoyable class.</span><br />I thought the instructor of this class was very helpful in learning. It&iquest;s was an online class but it was easy to understand topics in this class. Made it very easy to understand.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really enjoyed this class and I am so glad I made the option to do so. Dr. Rogers was one of my favorite professors I have ever had in college. Every lecture was very informative and interesting. He was very understanding and respectful to students. I really admire how patient he was and how he was constantly encouraging us to give him feedback!</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">nice, helpful, interesting</span><br />This instructor, as I previously stated, is easily one of the best instructors that I have had. He really cares about his students. He gives us all the information that we need to succeed in his course. I have always felt well prepared for the exams. I would definitely take another course led by him.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think the instructor was especially empathetic to student's concerns and was frequently available when content in the class was confusing.</span><br />This was a great instructor. I was having issues with my laptop and he made everything available to me and offered an extension. Definitely puts the needs of the students first.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Everything that this professor put together was for the benefit of our learning. It never felt unnecessarly time consuming. His exam format was a good mix between multiple choice and short answer.</span><br />i really appreciated this professor and loved his style of work. he never made the course feel like a burden or too much work.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">One of the best professors I have had at the University of Delaware by far.</span><br />I don't think I could have asked for a better instructor. He is extremely kind and understanding. From what I gathered, he's also optimistic and funny. One thing I really appreciated was his use of pronouns throughout the course and acknowledgement of different genders. I'm sure it makes people feel appreciated and understood. He's also really easy to reach through email and always responds with understanding, encouragement, and help. I would love to take another course of his or see him again on campus at some point. 11/10 for Mr. Rogers :)<br /><span style="color: #000000;">He's always considerate of students and truly wants the best for them. He has a relaxed class structure but the amount of work and additional resources on psychology keep us on our feet. 10/10 would take a class from Professor Rogers again</span><br />He was a great instructor and I would definitely take his class again.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Mr. Rogers was fantastic. I wish other professors used the tools of Canvas as effectively as him. The only minor problem I had sometimes in the course was when some assignments did not become available sometimes. It was an easy fix as Mr. Rogers was always just an email away to quickly fix the issue.</span><br />Prof. Rogers was amazing! He always gave me great feedback and offered extensions if I needed it because of work. The exams were kind of tricky but the lectures made up for it.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I thought Rodgers did a great job teaching this course. Obviously online class is not ideal for me but he was very accommodating and flexible with most things.</span><br />I really enjoyed this course and how it was taught. The lectures were always very interesting, especially when paired with the discussion posts. Typically I find discussion posts unnecessary, difficult to complete, and overall not enjoyable. But for this class, <span style="color: #000000;">Lee made them relevant and very interesting to answer and discuss. I also liked the use of the quizzes during the lecture videos. They were not difficult, but existed mainly to make sure we were paying attention and I found them very helpful. Lee was very accommodating with everything and was willing to help and make changes to make the class more interesting and better for us. I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot from every lecture.</span><br />I think that Professor Rogers was very good about handling technical issues, as well as making the course manageable and interesting. I would definitely take another class with him!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">One of the nicest and most understanding professors! Even though this class was asyn it was so well put together and I have learned so much.</span><br />He has been the most flexible, easy going, understanding professor I have ever had. He is always focused on making sure classes are as stress free and convenient as possible. He always asks for feedback and checks in on how students are feeling. <span style="color: #000000;">Easily one of the best professors I have had and completely catered to all students needs.</span><br />This instructor was extremely organized and truly seemed like he valued teaching others about psychology. I was very grateful I got him as a teacher over winter break. The only issues I had was with canvas not always working but that was completely unrelated to how well this professor ran his class.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I appreciate how flexible professor Leeland was and I also appreciate that the class was njot as much work as maybe some others, but this made me want to learn more because the class didn't feel like such a burden.</span><br />He was very accomodating, wise, and helpful. He made the class as pressure free as possible, without taking away from imporant content. He organzied it well.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Describe a concrete positive suggestion for how instruction can be improved. For example, something a different instructor does that works well.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">n/a<br /><span style="color: #000000;">i loved how this class was structured</span><br />I don't have any suggestions!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">none</span><br />Professor Rodgers is an amazing teacher and I don&iquest;t have anything negative to say.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Concrete positive suggestion - truly cannot think of anything. Love how this course connects textbook definitions to real-life examples to research theories and development. Straight-forward and engaging</span><br />N/A<br /><span style="color: #000000;">having the quizzes during the videos helped!</span><br />.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">The examples provided in the lectures should be different from the one's in the textbook.</span><br />I like how we have three days to take the tests and he is very flexible to change the class to fit better with how people learn.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Overall, I thought this course was taught extremely well, going in depth on all the topics and giving information in a creative manner. I can't think of anything that could improve the instruction of this course, as everything was extremely well thought out.</span><br />n/a<br /><span style="color: #000000;">This course could be improved with a bit more in depth analysis of topics. I enjoyed the course and understand that it is an introductory psychology course but with a little more focus on certain topics students could be getting more out of it.</span><br />The overall form of instruction for this course was completely satisfactory and easy to understand. The only change I would suggest to enable better conversation between professor and student, would be to provide some form of daily interaction (maybe a typed response at the end of each lecture video) to encourage the student to ask a question or make some kind of comment.<br />I<span style="color: #000000;">f the professor could continue to leave exams with no time limit it would be extremely beneficial to future students. When allowed as much time as possible, more thought and effort can be put into the open ended portion of the exam and gives the oppportunity to do as well as they possibly can.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I personally believe that the class was taught perfectly.</span><br />I think that the course was very well thought out and that the lectures and spacing were very well organized. One thing that I would suggest, seen from other asynchronous classes, is to hold a meeting (either class or office hours) at the beginning of the week to provide an overview of the lectures and assignments for the week and to answer any additional questions. (I think that the course was fine without this anyhow)<br /><span style="color: #000000;">N/A</span><br />No suggestions. The professor did an excellent job<br /><span style="color: #000000;">A final project or paper versus a final exam may have been a cool idea to express what we were most interested in</span><br />I dont really have a suggestion here from another instructor as this was the most organized and well structured online class I have had so far.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Keep it the way it is. I think it's perfect right now.</span><br />Nothing, the instruction and inclusion and frequent opportunity to give feedback was great!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Overall, I don&iquest;t have anything to say about what could be improved. I think he set this course up very well, especially considering we didn&iquest;t have actual class time. There was plenty of examples and extra videos to make sure we understood each topic.</span><br />Could provide more feedback on exams but I understand if the answers cannot be released due to the size of the class.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I feel that no improvements are needed to be made, instruction was perfect.</span><br />adding more notes to powerpoints<br /><span style="color: #000000;">He always presented the material very clearly and was always very clear about what was expected of us that day and what was on exams.</span><br />Nothing really was a really great teacher<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I honestly feel as if I can't really give any suggestions on how to improve this course. Dr. Rogers was an amazing professor and I hope I get him as a professor again in the future.</span><br />all good<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think Professor Rogers was one of the most caring professors that I have had at UD. He takes all of his students' feedback into consideration and makes changes based on the feedback. I can't think of how to improve the instruction because it is already better than all of my other UD courses.</span><br />I don't think the instructor did anything that made me upset with the way he taught the course. I would maybe prefer if we had to read some research articles along with the work, but I am also a senior taking a freshman level class and I don't think that would be appropriate for that class level anyway. <span style="color: #000000;">It would be a fun addition though.</span><br />I know the class was asynchronous, but maybe have the class meet once a week for 20 minutes and have a discussion.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">None - I was very satisfied.</span><br />I personally was very satisfied with how my professor handled this course. If anything i think i'm going to be recommending other professors to teach the same way this one has.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Nothing</span><br />I know this sounds like a lazy answer, but nothing. Great professor and wonderful presentation of the course. I really enjoyed taking this and getting to meet Mr. Rogers<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I thought that the class was honestly perfect and really could not be made any better. He took all the feedback the class gave.</span><br />I have no suggestions as the course was perfect for the format Winter session is. Easy assignments everyday, quick feedback and grading for exams each week, and great supplemental material.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Maybe offer more multiple-choice questions and fewer short answer questions with the option to be able to freely elaborate thoughts.</span><br />I really thought my professor did a great job I wouldn't change anything<br /><span style="color: #000000;">The only thing that I could think that could be improved is the amount of information on the slides. Even though information was said during the lecture videos, I found myself having to pause the video several times to take notes, and it was difficult to turn on captions. If the slides were a little more in depth so I could copy the notes down, it would have been more convenient for me.</span><br />Nothing<br /><span style="color: #000000;">none</span><br />I honestly don't have any suggestions for this professor or this class. I was pretty unlucky with my professors last semester and how they ran their classes so I really couldn't be happier with how well Professor Rodgers organized/ ran his class.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really enjoyed this class and the way it was presented so I would not change anything.</span><br />He was a very good professor, and would honestly recommend his teaching style to other professors.</span></p>
