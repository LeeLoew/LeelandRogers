<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Your own specific thoughts on the instructor for this course are very important. Please use this space to review the instructor. Write as little or as much as you like (up to 4000 characters). Your input is extremely valuable.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">I loved this professor. Very flexible and always helped anyone that needed to help. Replied to emails in a timely manner. OVerall a great professor.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I really appreciated the fact that this professor would answer our discussions and exams in the form of a video.</span><br />I can&iquest;t even explain how helpful Professor Lee was. He made this class so enjoyable and interesting. I have never been a fan of online classes but this felt so similar to being in a classroom and the course work and schedule were perfect for students with jobs and other responsibilities!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I really liked that he responded to all of our prompts, and that he always took our needs into consideration. I really appreciated how he adapted the class to an online environment to help learning</span><br />n/a<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I have truly gained an appreciation for the field of psychology and understand the value psychologists add to the community after taking this course. </span>The professor is extremely organized; the class is well structured and I always know what types of assignments to anticipate. The course is not "over kill" in the sense that we have a good number of truly purposeful and engaging assignments. Though the class was online, I firmly believe the instructor has made this online class more engaging than most of my in person classes taken at UD. The professor is extremely understanding, accommodating, easy to reach via email, and motivating. For every exam and discussion board assignment, he responded to EACH student via a quick message or video; I have never felt like my thoughts and contributions to the course have been valued to the extent that this teacher commits. It has been a pleasure taking this course. The lectures explain the information is a very easy to understand manner; I like that he includes a lot of relatable content because it shows he wants to format the class in a way that benefits students the most. There were many opportunities for creative expression, like with the discussion posts, which I welcomed. It is clear that Lee designed the course with the students in mind, and that definitely did not go unnoticed :) I would HIGHLY recommend this professor.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">This instructor I have to say was the best one that I have had at UD. I am so glad I got to take this class with him. I enjoyed the lecture videos as well as the "bonus videos" they helped me a lot. He was very flexible with my personal issues helping me more than I ever asked for. I can genuinely say that this has been my favorite class at UD.</span><br />He is very invested in and cares for his students, even in a short session all online it was still made very personal<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">This was one of the best taught courses I've had at UD. During such a hard time, he was extremely understanding and helpful. It is very clear that he put alot of effort into making this class manageable and stress free.</span><br />Professor Rogers was by far one of the best professors I have ever had. He made the course intriguing and interesting. The individual feedback was extremely thoughtful and it made the class enjoyable.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Although I have only been a student at UD for one year, I would definitely consider this instructor to be one of my favorites so far. He is an extremely understanding and thoughtful person who values his students and wants them to be as successful as possible. He constantly would ask for feedback from students on the structure of the class, and would actually listen to what students have to say and make changes he thought was necessary and best for everybody. He really made class content interesting, and would provide bonus videos about the day's content that were really interesting to watch. I wish this class was able to be held in person, but he did the best he could to make the online class experience as in-person as possible. He is truly a great person and instructor.</span><br />very understanding and nice<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Great prof, very respectful, timely, understanding. Would have loved to take more of his classes. 11/10</span><br />The instructor was very helpful and supportive of all students. He was very helpful and prompt when giving feedback and was always sure to provide suggestions on ways to improve and think critically about topics. He was also very receptive to feedback from students and worked to make the class manageable and informative at the same time. This class was enjoyable and instructive largly due to his instruction!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I love Professor Roger, he was always enthusiastic and really presented the course materials to the class well. He made the course not too stressful and was able to accommodate if anyone had issues brought up throughout the course.</span><br />I enjoyed this class more than any class that I have taken and I am a third year student. Professor Rogers was so caring a personable. You can tell that he has a passion for what he does and he makes the learning experience so effortless and organic. If I ever have the opportunity to take a class with <span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Professor Rogers again I will not hesitate to do so!</span><br />He was AWESOME! Best professor<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think you did an phenomenal job with giving feedback on all the assignments! I really liked the video responses a lot.</span><br />this instructor is great.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">nothing</span><br />Amazing instructor and very understanding and knowledgable.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The professor is very nice and helpful. He explains things in an engaging way and is always enthusiastic about the content. He went out of his way to make sure we felt like we were face-to-face with the video responses. He is very fair and makes the work manageable.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">This instructor was very nice and took his time to reach out to everybody, even if you did not</span><br />Leeland was amazing! Super flexible, very knowledgeable and SUPER personable. I LOVED the video feedback to our discussion posts, it made me feel like I was more than just a student submitting work but that he personally cares about us individually and what we contribute to the course. I would LOVE to take another course with him in the further.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I love the timings of the lectures and the way he teaches everything is just so good and easy to comprehend. The exams are from the course content and also allows you to explore and take inspiration. I love the way he adds some additional videos for extra information which interests me the most.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think that everything that Professor Rogers has done thus far has been very impressive. He is by far one of my favorite professors that i have had at the University of Delaware. His charismatic manner and obvious care for his students is so refreshing. I also really enjoy his assignment and testing style.</span><br />he was the best instructor ive had<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The instructor made the course extremely interesting and the video feedback given made the class feel more personal given the format. The instructor was clearly well versed and enthusiastic. He encouraged further reading and viewing bonus videos which further increased understanding.</span><br />The instructor was thoughtful and kind to students, did everything within his power to make the course cause as little stress as possible for students while still very effectively teaching the content in a way that I was engaged in lectures and wanted to learn more about each topic.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think this instructor was very good and engaging with the students. He made the class a place where you could learn and have fun.</span><br />I am impressed with this professor. I adored his class schedule and the way the class was set up. The lectures were the perfect length and the course was easy and straight to the point. This professor was extremely nice to all and he gave feedback whenever he could and was open to changing anything if we needed it.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Great Teacher would take the class again if I could.</span><br />The instructor is respectful in his presentations and giving feedback. I admire that he reviews every student's written response to discussion board posts. It is an interesting class.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I like our instructor for this class. He showed great interest in the lessons he chose to teach and was able to transfer his knowledge to me with no trouble. When I had questions, he was a quick email away and always gave great feedback, even if the questions, have nothing to do with what we just learned. Also, he is very forgiving and very understanding of other students living accommodations, time zones, and troubles and is very flexible when it comes to making sure they have enough time to complete the assignment. I also like the fact that I was able to argue some of the questions he gave us on exams, and if we believed the answer was correct he'd give us points as long as the justification is valid for the topic. Overall if he taught another class I would definitely take it.</span><br />I think the instructor did really well accommodating for different students and their needs, taking feedback from students and ACTUALLY using the criticism or thoughts to improve the class. He was very open to answering any questions, set up a time for office hours, and responded to exams through short videos. I think that was one of the best parts of the class. The short videos responded to the feedback we gave at the end of every exam and it was really different from the lack of attention other instructors give to students, so I thought that was very cool. Instructor spoke clearly and got his point across on every topic and even added extra material if a student was interested in learning more, but was not necessarily required. 10/10 would recommend this instructor to anyone.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The instructor was very respectful and responsive. He cares about the material he teaches and always is available if anyone needs anything.</span><br />The instructor was very fun, understanding, and knowledgable. He clearly explained what was expected and how he was willing to work with the students especially in a time like this. He presented the material very efficiently and thoroughly and even added bonus videos for us to watch for examples or further information.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Lee was absolutely amazing! He was so understanding and flexible during these challenging times. Additionally, exams were challenging and required critical thinking, but we were allowed plenty of time to put in the necessary work and research. He was absolutely amazing with communication and being inclusive. Many of the examples used in class included vague gender pronouns, a variety of races, and different sexualities, which I appreciated as a minority.</span><br />Lee gave great feedback in the form of either written posts or via short videos which were invaluable. It made the class a lot more enjoyable than what I was expecting for an online class.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I thought my instructor seemed very passionate about the subject he was teaching and was very engaging. The videos were interesting and well done. He seems to care how his students do and he also provided extra little videos to watch in their free time which also showed us he cared.</span><br />Leeland Rogers was a phenomenal instructor. Even though there was so many students and it was online, I felt that he really cared about everyone's success and he took the time to make the course interesting but also informative. He went above and beyond by making short video comments for exams and written discussions which made the class and feedback more helpful and very personal.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I believe Mr. Lee is one of the best instructors I've had at UD and I haven't even met him in person. He genuinely cares about giving the students the best form of instruction for the material and is very open-minded and flexible about how the course is structured and ran because online classes are pretty new now. If I could, I would definitely take another course that Mr. Lee is teaching.</span><br />The most engaged teacher I have ever had, which resulted in me being the most engaged in a class I have ever been<br />the instructor is very helpful in my study<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Lee is a nice professor</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Describe a concrete positive suggestion for how instruction can be improved. For example, something a different instructor does that works well.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I love professor Leeland nothing to improve!!!</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I were to appreciate if I knew the topics of the week before they were posted as modules.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I honestly loved this class so much I don&iquest;t think there is anything to improve</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">N.A., I can't think of anything</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">n/a</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Not applicable</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I genuinely do not have any suggestions, the class was amazing and there is nothing to really improve upon.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Sometimes I like having more work published at once to get ahead</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Perhaps providing a little more detail in the lecture rather than reading the textbook.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">N/A</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Everything that the professor did for the class at a time like this really showed his dedication to his students learning, as he wanted to make the experience of it being an online class the best that it could be. I think one way instruction can be improved is during the video lectures instead of using examples of concepts, ideas, etc. directly from the textbook, maybe bringing in different examples would be beneficial. As someone who would both read the textbook and watched the video lectures, there were times where I wished I had another example to refer to so I could have a better understanding of a topic. I think providing these examples during the video lecture or even as bonus content could help.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">no suggestion</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">quizzes were good</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Sometimes I felt that the amount of material varied greatly from one class to the next. There were some days when I felt very underwhelmed by the amount of information and the rest of the time I felt there was a good amount of new information. I never felt overwhelmed, but I do feel as though some information could be moved to have more consistent amounts of information across classes or even add a little more information.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">The instructor was amazing, he was willing to accommodate everyone expectation's for the course and provided good lectures and graded assignments in time.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I really have no complaints towards this professor. He was amazing and extremely helpful!</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Nothing, I loved this course!</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think adding in a project in place of one of the exams would be really helpful! It will not only engage the students with the class material but also give us a chance to engage with our classmates since engagement is limited to due online courses.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I enjoyed everything</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">nothing</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I love the discussion prompts as well as how flexible the professor is in terms of the assignment dates. I missed a discussion prompt because we usually take quizzes and I was a bit occupied, but he gave us an extra day to turn it in and I am very grateful for how understanding and lenient he is, especially during these troubled times. I know this was supposed to be in person so I think that it was transitioned really well. I also love how he takes into consideration what the students want and how he tried to keep the videos a certain length. I also love how he gives a heads up on what the written prompts for the exams will be as they help.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">For lecture videos, I think some of the slides could be more organized and laid out easier for students to take notes from.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">less open ended</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think Leeland should upload the weeks work instead of night by night so we can move faster in the course.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">The instructor is really helpful and spontaneous with answering out doubts and questions on any content from the course. The instructor also is really easy to communicate with and also the instructor's lectures are so informative and effective that he conveys the content and information he has to convey in a straight forward manner and I love the timings of the lectures and the way he teaches everything is just so good and easy to comprehend. <span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The exams are from the course content and also allows you to explore and take inspiration. I love the way he adds some additional videos for extra information which interests me the most.</span></span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">No improvements needed.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">make quizes harder</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Socratic Seminar's or discussions could have been possible through Zoom in small groups. I believe that would have elevated the class greatly.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I honestly can&iquest;t think of anything. For the nature of the problems we are currently facing, I think the instructor did everything possible to ensure the course was fun and informative, and was challenging but not stressful. I would have liked to engage more with others in the course, but given timezone differences and heightened stress levels overall, things like group projects, multilayer discussions or zoom lectures would have been inappropriate.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think this constructor did well, as he was engaging with his students and was always looking to help us.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">this professor was fantastic. The course and the way he presented it was perfect for a summer course and I would love to take a course with him again.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">He ran the class very well I think every teacher should run there class like him.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I like how this course is structured.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">The only thing I would comment on is having the next class lecture materials be opened earlier than the time it is usually posted, since I like to read the chapters ahead of time before watching the lectures and I tend to stay up late at night because the chapter assignments would be posted later at night.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think the summer class was very well put together. The only thing I would ask of is maybe having all the lectures and quizzes/discussions posted on Monday and then everything due Thursday night. Then, have access to the exam for each week open Friday morning until Sunday night. I think just having a little bit of flexibility with the daily assignments would be nice... even if we are completing them all in one day, we wouldn't have to worry about it on other days if we had something to do.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think this was one of the best online courses that I have been taught</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think it would have been nice to have a scheduled zoom meeting every Monday as just a way to introduce that week's topics and a way for us to communicate and voice our questions or concerns.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Sometimes, Lee would just say "great job!" It was a confidence boosting complement, but it also would have been nice to receive a little bit of constructive feedback, even on the assignments that I received 100% on.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">No comment, this is my first psych class and I thought Lee was a wonderful instructor</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Instruction can be improved by writing directions and important information in bold and a different color. Since it was online this semester, my instructor was very clear with laying out the instructions and it was easy to follow through.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The only thing that could maybe be helpful would be a weekly live zoom session where students could interact and ask each other questions or something.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Since it is one of the first few online classes I have taken there aren't many things that I have seen someone else do better. I feel like this class was the best in terms of translating it to the online format in my experience. I would suggest maybe adding a couple more discussion threads for students to interact with each other.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">nothing</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">no</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I have no idea.</span></p>
