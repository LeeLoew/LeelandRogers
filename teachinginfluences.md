Small Teaching by James Lang has had a major influence on my approach to teaching. The integration of cognitive theory and effecacious instructional techniques was a wonderful starting point when I began teaching and inspires me to consider all of my course planning through an emperical cognitive lens.

As part of my effort to self-educate and strive for inclusivity in the classroom, I have greatly appriciated The Critical Pedagogy Reader. The insightful perspectives provided within this text has been invaluable to me and my goals to build toward an equitable and inclusive learning environment for my students.
