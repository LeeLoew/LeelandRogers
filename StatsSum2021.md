<p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Essay Question #1: Summer I Your own specific thoughts on the instructor for this course are very important. Please use this space to review the instructor. Write as little or as much as you like (up to 4000 characters). Your input is extremely valuable.</strong></span></p>
<p>loved lee. loved the class. hope I can take more of his classes in the future<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Lee is an exceedingly nice person who is very good at teaching concepts in an easily digestible way. He is always available for questions and help if needed and is more than happy to extend deadlines if students are struggling; I got sick and he was more than happy to accommodate for this no questions asked. My education has benefited from taking this class with Lee and I am happy I got to meet such a wonderful human while living on earth!</span><br />Prof Rogers was an excellent professor. I had taken this course once before and did not do well. I couldn't understand the material, the professor was never available, and she made the information incredibly difficult to digest. Prof Rogers is the complete opposite. He works with his students, provides feedback on every exam telling us how we are doing, asks us for feedback at the end of every exam, and is overall a really kind person. He made this class easy to understand and fun to learn about. I hope there's another class I can take from him before he leaves the University.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">My input is about the same as I wrote in the last question.</span><br />My professor always treat us in patience, he is very nice and always help me figue out any problems.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">He was one of the best professors I've had at UD so far. I would definitely take another class with him. The class was organized and straightforward. </span>He was always willing to help and always provided feedback as well as always being flexible and understanding about each individual students situation. Overall just a wonderful professor and a great class.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Lee was an awesome professor. He was extremely understanding, accommodating, and supportive of his students and their needs. I felt supported by him and I felt that he wanted to see us succeed. I would definitely recommend this professor to a friend, and I would take another class with him myself if I could.</span><br />Professor Rogers is the most accommodating professor I've had at UD so far. He gave a very appropriate amount of work- not too much to the point where I was stressed, but enough that I was able to get comfortable with the material and understand it. He was extremely understanding and I could tell he cares a lot about his students. I think at times he could be a little "harder" on us, but I cannot appreciate his efforts enough throughout this course. One of my best decisions was taking this class, and I truly hope I have Professor Rogers again at some point during my time at UD.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">This is actually my second time taking this specific course and my grade differences are outrageous! Professor Rogers takes his time to address any possible misconceptions or misunderstanding of material in order to make sure everyone is able to understand. He always offers time to meet up in office hours and he is always quick to answer emails. My favorite part of the class were Professor Rogers individual videos he would make after every exam addressing any wrong answers and what not. I have never had a Professor do this and it was a great surprise that ensured me he was actually taking his time to connect with his students despite the online environment.</span><br />Throughout the four or so online semesters I have taken so far, Professor Rogers has been ultimately the best! Very understanding, FLEXIBLE- which is great for students, especially during such times. You can also tell Professor Rogers enjoys what he does as a professor and teaching undergrad on a not-so-easy topic (statistics) through his effort and support. He always made sure if we had any difficulty or questions on anything, always to ask. My overall course grade reflects the effort I put into this course and how well of an instructor Professor Rogers is. The exams were well structured; they allowed me to challenge myself while using creativity in some questions, giving me the ability to practice what I had learned in lectures thoughtfully. Not sure exactly who is reading this other than Professor Rogers; however, in psychology, there are two mindsets-- the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. People who have a fixed mindset always desire to look intelligent and avoid any obstacles, challenges that may interfere with their image of intelligence. A person who has a growth mindset does take on any challenges, doesn't avoid any obstacles, puts maximum effort, they learn from criticism to get a better understanding. When I first started this course, I wasn't confident, shy, and afraid to challenge myself. However, I feel that now I'm ending the semester with a growth mindset. Thanks to Professor Rogers. Also, because of his teaching skills and effort, I was able to finally understand concepts that I've previously learned in other statistics courses.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I really liked that we were able to do a lot of the work on our own time but still had the opportunity to come for questions during a scheduled Zoom on Fridays.The questions in the lecture videos kept me on track and helped a lot. I have now officially completed a full year of college and this has been my favorite class by far!</span><br />Loved him! super nice and easy to work with!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I really liked how the professor was constantly available for any questions and whenever any students had any concerns about the course or about coursework, he was always flexible with changing some deadlines to accommodate the students.</span><br />I very much appreciate how open this instructor was with the students in this class. He was always available for questions and laid out the class to be as accessible for students as possible.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Professor Rogers is one of the best instructors I have had since coming to Delaware. All of the video lectures kept me engaged in what was going on. </span>If this was an in-person class it would've been even better, but the online setup was amazing. Thank you, professor Rogers!!!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I heard this class was difficult and was nervous about taking it, but the professor made it enjoyable and much less stressful than I thought it would be. </span>He was flexible with my schedule and extended deadlines for me when needed. I also really appreciate the video comments he gave, it made the class feel more personal even though we were online. You can tell he really cares about teaching and about his students.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Amazing teacher and class. The way it was structured was really good.</span><br />I think this instructor was honestly the most considerate and flexible instructor I have had throughout the pandemic. He really understood the needs of the students and was understanding of any issues that arose. I really appreciated how much our feedback was used to make alterations to course delivery.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">One of the best instructors I had</span><br />I think Professor Li is responsible to every student. At the end of each exam, he will record a video for each student to point out where the student's specific problem lies in the exam, and tell us what should be the best.</p>

<p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Essay Question #2: Describe a concrete positive suggestion for how instruction can be improved. For example, something a different instructor does that works well.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">no suggestions. loved this class<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I cannot think of anything to suggest. Lee's class was very well run.</span><br />I don't think there is anything for Prof Rogers to improve. He ran this class excellently, always encouraged us to ask questions, and was available whenever someone needed him.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Honestly, I thought the class was great. No improvements needed, the professor was very organized and helpful and made the material clear and easy to understand.</span><br />Nothing I think should improve.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I thought everything in this class was very organized and worked very well. The only thing that I can think of that I would change would be adding in study guides or worksheets to reinforce the material.</span><br />I would not change anything about this course or the instruction.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">To be honest, I do not have any suggestions for how Professor Rogers can improve his instruction- it was great.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think Professor Rogers did the best he possibly could, I don&iquest;t have any input other than this has 100% been one of my top 3 classes here at UD because of him.</span><br />There aren't many suggestions to give. Professor Rogers was great! And he provided a well-structured course.<br />maybe go over answers to questions from exams or quizzes to help clear confusion and set students on correct path<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I don't have any suggestions, I really liked how the instructor constantly asked if he could improve on anything to help out the students and make the course easier.</span><br />I do not think there is much, if any, room for improvement. I feel as though the way this instructor handles and organizes this course should have been the standard for all online courses. Being outside of the classroom environment, I love the openness of the professor and the assignments. This allows the students to take full advantage of having online classes.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">maybe add in a little bit more group work where we can help each other!</span><br />N/A , I don't think this class needs improvement.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Other instructors should take note from this instructor.</span><br />I think one thing that is really helpful is a professor having a discussion board for students to post questions they have and then the instructor, as well as other classmates, are able to reply. This allows us to check there first to see if another student had the same question and you already answered it before reaching out and you having to potentially answer the same question several times over email.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">none</span><br />No</span></p>
