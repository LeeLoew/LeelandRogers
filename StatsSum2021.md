<p><strong><span style="color: #843fa1;">Essay Question #1: Summer I Your own specific thoughts on the instructor for this course are very important. Please use this space to review the instructor. Write as little or as much as you like (up to 4000 characters). Your input is extremely valuable.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Professor Rogers was absolutely amazing. Each day I actually looked forward to logging in and reviewing the modules for that day. He made the content very interesting and always provided bonus content for those who were interested in learning more. He made himself very accessible for anyone with questions or concerns. I think my favorite part was receiving a personalized video discussing my work on each exam. I truly appreciated him taking the time to do that for each student and it meant a lot to me, it really motivated me to work harder. If I could have him for other classes, I would! I think other instructors at UD could learn a thing or two from him.</span><br />Professor Leeland, you are such an awesome instructor. You are such a blessing to students like me.<br />he is so helpful and cool<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Professor Roger's is great! He is a very understanding teacher and always reaches out to students in a timely manner. He does not have his exams timed., like other professors I had. Instead, he gave us the weekend to complete the exam, and did not have a time limit, which was helpful. He made this course extremely manageable and is a fair grader.</span><br />pretty good<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">For an online psychology course, I thought this class was handled very well. The professor was very well prepared and I was very impressed with the video he made. It really showed he cared about this class when other professors just posted PowerPoints. I enjoyed watching the lectures!</span><br />He was always extremely understanding and willing to help students with whatever they may have needed. You can tell how much he enjoyed teaching and that makes the class more enjoyable for the students as well. I loved the way that the quizzes were imputed to the lecture made it way easier. I also loved the layout of the canvas I think other professors should model their canvas after his.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Professor Leeland is probably one of the best professors I have had. He takes into consideration the students feelings and thoughts and always welcomed feedback. He was always available for questions and was accommodating, understanding, and supportive. He put together presentations that were informative but also not too overwhelming and the course was structured in a simple way with appropriate assignments and exams. I would love to take more courses with Professor Leeland as my instructor. His lectures were unbiased and he was always mindful of all students when presenting information that may be sensitive to some students. Very amazing instructor!</span><br />This instructor was quite possibly the most effective one I have had throughout my entire college education experience. He was ALWAYS accommodating and understanding of various struggles students in the class had, including me- Within the second week of class, many of my own concerns and those shared by my peers were addressed and adjusted to relieve some of the worries we had, especially with it being an online class this semester. I also always got feedback on my writing, as it pertains to the way I wrote my short answers on the exams, and when I would reach out with questions over email, I would get a quick response. I also really enjoyed how the lecture videos were sprinkled with little jokes and a light-hearted presence, but also disclaimers as they pertained to certain information the textbook discussed, but that wasn't entirely inclusive of other information that should be talked about. Overall, I have thoroughly enjoyed the instructor, his calm/caring demeanor, and the inclusivity he promotes of all people.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The professor's typically positive and enthusiastic tone made lectures more enjoyable. He kept to the relevant topics but was not afraid to wing it or to share his own thoughts. His emphasis on respecting the identities of others was very nice to see. As a(n aspiring) scientist, I enjoyed the strong commitment to the values of the scientific method throughout the course. The professor was not afraid to criticize older theories or to issue corrections over the textbook.</span><br />Awesome instructor. I hope there are other courses in my major where he will be the instructor.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">i think he went out of his way to accommodate students and genuinely just wants them to succeed and learn the material. this has been the best online course that i have taken which includes classes i took online before covid. i would love to be able to take another with him he was great and i loved his style of lectures and the setup of the course as a whole!</span><br />The instructor was very understanding of their students and seemed to genuinely want our feedback. Not only did the professor request feedback, but our feedback was also heard and applied in order to make class both enjoyable and fair.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The instructor made the expectations of the course and the feedback of the course very clear. He does talk a bit fast which isn't as big of a deal in a video but in person it would be much harder to follow. He was helpful and flexible.</span><br />He was a very good instructor. He always helped whenever you needed it and he also helped when you didn't think you needed it. He was very flexible for a summer course, which I thought was very reasonable because like me, a lot of students work over summer. I worked every day, and I did not even need to change my schedule for this course because the work was doable. I will definitely try and take another course with professor Rogers. I would love to have an in person class with him.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Instructor was very understanding when it came to his course.</span><br />This professor is amazing. He makes sure his students are ok and understand the class material, and is always available to answer questions about the course.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">He was very understanding and organized. He listened to students feedback and implemented changes that addressed them.</span><br />Professor Rogers was always super enthusiastic and seemed very excited to share his knowledge of psychology with us students. This made the course very enjoyable and made completing the work so much easier.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">This instructor was fantastic. This instructor did a very great job teaching online and also giving great individual feedbacks!</span><br />Professor Rogers was amazing. Best college professor I have had to date.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Professor Rogers was phenomenal in breaking down material that actively involved the textbook which gave more of an understanding of what was being taught. I would recommend him to everyone that thinks about taking this course because that is how great he is. During today&iquest;s stressful times Rogers created a bearable and relaxed setting that was important for my mental health and I think him for that.</span><br />The instructor was always professional and honest. The first week of this course my housemates were like "is this on youtube?" because he presented so well. He always seems very approachable and open to feedback. I was so relieved when he allowed open notes and such on exams. This class was one of the least stressful classes I have had since co-vid and I think it was all because the instructor was so on it and understanding. I hope he is successful in his future career. If he ever becomes a full-time professor, I think his students will be extremely lucky.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">This is my last course at UD and the best class I ever took since the Covid. The lecture, course materials, and assignments are all well thought and designed. I look forward to learning new materials every week. It was a fun class. I was able to gain a lot of kownlegeges without feeling stress. Thank you!</span><br />all good<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">good</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #843fa1;">Essay Question #2: Describe a concrete positive suggestion for how instruction can be improved. For example, something a different instructor does that works well.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #7e8c8d;"><span style="color: #000000;">I honestly cannot think of anything that could be improved with Professor Rogers. This class was excellent in every way.</span><br />I have nothing to suggest because this course has worked well for me. It's been easy learning the concepts because of the generosity of the professor in sharing his knowledge and making sure that the lessons are presented creatively and clearly. THANK YOU SO MUCH, Professor.<br />little quizzes were helpful<br /><span style="color: #000000;">One thing I would suggest is to keep putting each weekend's module ahead of time.</span><br />everything is great<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Something I think would be good to fix the technical bugs of the online quizzes sometimes it'd glitch otherwise it was great!</span><br />Overall this is one of the best classes I have taken at UD it was extremely organized and well planned and thought out. I liked how after the first week the work for the following week was all posted so students could get work done in advance.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">n/a</span><br />I could not have asked for a better instructor for this course, I have no suggestions to give, as he was very accommodating to the struggles students expressed throughout the course.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">n/a</span><br />I've only had three instructors for online asynchronous learning and I love them all. I also loved how this class was taught and can't think of anything that can make it better. All questions were answered promptly and all problems with computer issues and grades were taken care of. I think this class was taught perfectly. I learned a lot and I actually find myself using what I've learned or observing things I've learn in my everyday life. Job well done on my part.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">i cannot think of anything that would improve this class</span><br />I really appreciated the format of this class. Because it is a summer course, the flexibility was very helpful to complete assignments in cognizant with our own schedules. I don't think that I have any suggestions.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">One thing that I think would be helpful for this class would be to have a notes packet so during your lectures we can focus more on what is being said and less on taking notes.</span><br />He was very interested in what he was lecturing. It provided a clear understanding and a very thought provoking course. I really enjoyed how he presented his material and I think that the work load for this class at this time of year and COVID was a very good amount.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">This class was taught well which is why I have no suggestions.</span><br />Everything was good.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think that overall this course was fantastic. One thing that could be improved upon is more connections to real world examples. I know we covered real world connections in some chapters but I would appreciate more as connections to events that truly happened help show how the information is relevant.</span><br />Instructor honestly did a very great job!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">The instructor lets us learn stress free. I am never worried about my grade in this class and can focus on just learning.</span><br />I have no feedback to give because Professor Rogers teaching style and layout was perfect for me to understand the coursework without stress.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think the only concrete suggestion I can think of for how the instruction can improve is having subtitles available for the lectures/ videos or transcripts available for students with auditory discrepancies.</span><br />best online class so far and well organized. I enjoyed how the quiz is included in the lecture, it's felt very interactive and helps me to recall information. <span style="color: #000000;">Becuase the lecture is short, I was able to focus. Well designed course</span><br />all good<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I can't think of anything else this instructor would ned to improve on. He was very open to feedback, made the work challenging but manageable and interesting as well.</span><br />good enough</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Essay Question #1: Summer I Your own specific thoughts on the instructor for this course are very important. Please use this space to review the instructor. Write as little or as much as you like (up to 4000 characters). Your input is extremely valuable.</strong></span></p>
<p>loved lee. loved the class. hope I can take more of his classes in the future<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Lee is an exceedingly nice person who is very good at teaching concepts in an easily digestible way. He is always available for questions and help if needed and is more than happy to extend deadlines if students are struggling; I got sick and he was more than happy to accommodate for this no questions asked. My education has benefited from taking this class with Lee and I am happy I got to meet such a wonderful human while living on earth!</span><br />Prof Rogers was an excellent professor. I had taken this course once before and did not do well. I couldn't understand the material, the professor was never available, and she made the information incredibly difficult to digest. Prof Rogers is the complete opposite. He works with his students, provides feedback on every exam telling us how we are doing, asks us for feedback at the end of every exam, and is overall a really kind person. He made this class easy to understand and fun to learn about. I hope there's another class I can take from him before he leaves the University.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">My input is about the same as I wrote in the last question.</span><br />My professor always treat us in patience, he is very nice and always help me figue out any problems.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">He was one of the best professors I've had at UD so far. I would definitely take another class with him. The class was organized and straightforward. </span>He was always willing to help and always provided feedback as well as always being flexible and understanding about each individual students situation. Overall just a wonderful professor and a great class.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Lee was an awesome professor. He was extremely understanding, accommodating, and supportive of his students and their needs. I felt supported by him and I felt that he wanted to see us succeed. I would definitely recommend this professor to a friend, and I would take another class with him myself if I could.</span><br />Professor Rogers is the most accommodating professor I've had at UD so far. He gave a very appropriate amount of work- not too much to the point where I was stressed, but enough that I was able to get comfortable with the material and understand it. He was extremely understanding and I could tell he cares a lot about his students. I think at times he could be a little "harder" on us, but I cannot appreciate his efforts enough throughout this course. One of my best decisions was taking this class, and I truly hope I have Professor Rogers again at some point during my time at UD.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">This is actually my second time taking this specific course and my grade differences are outrageous! Professor Rogers takes his time to address any possible misconceptions or misunderstanding of material in order to make sure everyone is able to understand. He always offers time to meet up in office hours and he is always quick to answer emails. My favorite part of the class were Professor Rogers individual videos he would make after every exam addressing any wrong answers and what not. I have never had a Professor do this and it was a great surprise that ensured me he was actually taking his time to connect with his students despite the online environment.</span><br />Throughout the four or so online semesters I have taken so far, Professor Rogers has been ultimately the best! Very understanding, FLEXIBLE- which is great for students, especially during such times. You can also tell Professor Rogers enjoys what he does as a professor and teaching undergrad on a not-so-easy topic (statistics) through his effort and support. He always made sure if we had any difficulty or questions on anything, always to ask. My overall course grade reflects the effort I put into this course and how well of an instructor Professor Rogers is. The exams were well structured; they allowed me to challenge myself while using creativity in some questions, giving me the ability to practice what I had learned in lectures thoughtfully. Not sure exactly who is reading this other than Professor Rogers; however, in psychology, there are two mindsets-- the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. People who have a fixed mindset always desire to look intelligent and avoid any obstacles, challenges that may interfere with their image of intelligence. A person who has a growth mindset does take on any challenges, doesn't avoid any obstacles, puts maximum effort, they learn from criticism to get a better understanding. When I first started this course, I wasn't confident, shy, and afraid to challenge myself. However, I feel that now I'm ending the semester with a growth mindset. Thanks to Professor Rogers. Also, because of his teaching skills and effort, I was able to finally understand concepts that I've previously learned in other statistics courses.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I really liked that we were able to do a lot of the work on our own time but still had the opportunity to come for questions during a scheduled Zoom on Fridays.The questions in the lecture videos kept me on track and helped a lot. I have now officially completed a full year of college and this has been my favorite class by far!</span><br />Loved him! super nice and easy to work with!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I really liked how the professor was constantly available for any questions and whenever any students had any concerns about the course or about coursework, he was always flexible with changing some deadlines to accommodate the students.</span><br />I very much appreciate how open this instructor was with the students in this class. He was always available for questions and laid out the class to be as accessible for students as possible.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Professor Rogers is one of the best instructors I have had since coming to Delaware. All of the video lectures kept me engaged in what was going on. </span>If this was an in-person class it would've been even better, but the online setup was amazing. Thank you, professor Rogers!!!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I heard this class was difficult and was nervous about taking it, but the professor made it enjoyable and much less stressful than I thought it would be. </span>He was flexible with my schedule and extended deadlines for me when needed. I also really appreciate the video comments he gave, it made the class feel more personal even though we were online. You can tell he really cares about teaching and about his students.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Amazing teacher and class. The way it was structured was really good.</span><br />I think this instructor was honestly the most considerate and flexible instructor I have had throughout the pandemic. He really understood the needs of the students and was understanding of any issues that arose. I really appreciated how much our feedback was used to make alterations to course delivery.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">One of the best instructors I had</span><br />I think Professor Li is responsible to every student. At the end of each exam, he will record a video for each student to point out where the student's specific problem lies in the exam, and tell us what should be the best.</p>

<p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Essay Question #2: Describe a concrete positive suggestion for how instruction can be improved. For example, something a different instructor does that works well.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">no suggestions. loved this class<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I cannot think of anything to suggest. Lee's class was very well run.</span><br />I don't think there is anything for Prof Rogers to improve. He ran this class excellently, always encouraged us to ask questions, and was available whenever someone needed him.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Honestly, I thought the class was great. No improvements needed, the professor was very organized and helpful and made the material clear and easy to understand.</span><br />Nothing I think should improve.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I thought everything in this class was very organized and worked very well. The only thing that I can think of that I would change would be adding in study guides or worksheets to reinforce the material.</span><br />I would not change anything about this course or the instruction.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">To be honest, I do not have any suggestions for how Professor Rogers can improve his instruction- it was great.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think Professor Rogers did the best he possibly could, I don&iquest;t have any input other than this has 100% been one of my top 3 classes here at UD because of him.</span><br />There aren't many suggestions to give. Professor Rogers was great! And he provided a well-structured course.<br />maybe go over answers to questions from exams or quizzes to help clear confusion and set students on correct path<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I don't have any suggestions, I really liked how the instructor constantly asked if he could improve on anything to help out the students and make the course easier.</span><br />I do not think there is much, if any, room for improvement. I feel as though the way this instructor handles and organizes this course should have been the standard for all online courses. Being outside of the classroom environment, I love the openness of the professor and the assignments. This allows the students to take full advantage of having online classes.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">maybe add in a little bit more group work where we can help each other!</span><br />N/A , I don't think this class needs improvement.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Other instructors should take note from this instructor.</span><br />I think one thing that is really helpful is a professor having a discussion board for students to post questions they have and then the instructor, as well as other classmates, are able to reply. This allows us to check there first to see if another student had the same question and you already answered it before reaching out and you having to potentially answer the same question several times over email.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">none</span><br />No</span></p>
