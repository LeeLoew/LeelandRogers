<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">THIS COURSE WAS EVERYTHINGGGGGG. I loved what he taught, and how interactive the lessons were. He&iquest;s an awesome instructor<br /><span style="color: #000000;">n/a</span><br />One of the best instructors I have ever had. Love him.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">He was the best professor I ever had.</span><br />This instructor was extremely helpful and provided great help and advice.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I thought Professor Rogers was fantastic. He made this course the least amount stressful as possible which I appreciate so much. I really enjoyed learning from him and it was made abundantly clear that he genuinely cared for his students.</span><br />I felt like the instructor really cared about his students. He always gave us opportunities to give feedback about how we felt the course was going and I never felt overly stressed about the class.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">He's wonderful. So understanding and helpful. I always looked forward to this class.</span><br />I loved this instructor! He was always really engaging in his lectures. And he was also very understanding and compassionate about our needs and circumstances. I could also tell that he loves what he teaches.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I loved Professor Rogers. He made the class very interesting and was a very fair professor.</span><br />I really enjoyed the format of this class. It kept me engaged and I felt comfortable asking questions when needed. I appreciated the video feedback on the writing portions of the tests. They made me proud and satisfied with my work. The best class I have had online ever.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really liked this professor and the format of the class. The lectures were detailed and interesting but were not overwhelming and I felt liked I learned a lot this semester.</span><br />Although I did not get the chance to personally meet Professor Lee, he was by far one of my best professors so far in my college career. He was very understanding in all aspects of school and personal life. The assignments were interesting and easy to follow, and I genuinely enjoyed completing them. The amount of work given for this class was the perfect amount to keep us engaged while also not being too overwhelming. I would definitely recommend this class/professor to anyone!!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Leeland Rogers was by far the most understanding and sympathetic instructor I had this semester and definitely one of the best throughout my UD experience so far. I felt I could always reach out and always got quick responses, always got feedback for my work, and I felt as though I could apply this knowledge to the rest of my career. I felt listened to and I walk out of this course knowing I have a new connection to reach out to whenever.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really enjoyed this instructor. The assignments we were given promoted critical and creative thinking and overall I enjoyed watching class and learning the material.</span><br />This course was 100% creative as well as informational. I looked forward to this class every week. The professor was always there to answer questions, give feedback, and provide an amazing learning environment. This has to be one of my favorite courses and Professor Leeland is a big reason why! Had I taken this course with another professor I don't think I would've enjoyed it as much!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">The instructor was great, I'd love to take another class with them. Probably one of the best professors ive had at UD. Very understanding when it comes to the students.</span><br />He was so creative and kept us engaged with frequent short modules which were very informative but short, so it could keep our attention. I liked his style of teaching a lot and I would be very very inclined to choose him as a professor again.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">The best professor I have had, really wish I could have taken this course in class, he makes the material very engaging in his lecture quizzes and is always willing to work with students. Professor Rogers is the kindest and most thoughtful professor I have had.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">honestly best instructor i&iquest;ve ever had.</span><br />I could tell Professor Rogers did what he could to keep the class engaging and informative despite using an asynchronous class format. It was always clear that he had enthusiasm for the topics covered and I genuinely enjoyed class this semester. This class was my favorite format I've had for an asynchronous class and one of my favorite classes I've taken that was not in person. I felt like Professor Rogers personally cared that students grasped the material and was very open to any questions and help.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">If I would have preferred to have any professor to teach an asynchronous online class, it would be Lee. The class schedule is simple and consistent, so I always know when things will be due each week. The integrated quizzes in the lectures served as a great in-the-moment review, and the lecture videos were always engaging while covering lots of material. Lee is flexible and kind with his students, an attribute that is extremely appreciated especially during these times.</span><br />I loved how the lectures were set up where the professor was talking directly to us on the screen, and how he made the lectures interactive to ensure the student really understood the point he was trying to make.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">The best professor at UD, hands down not even close.</span><br />I loved the layout of this class and the instructor. He was very understanding and always available for help.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Honestly Professor Rogers was the best professor I've had in a while. Prof Rogers clearly had the students best interests in mind and was so kind and understanding. Especially considering the online format, Prof Rogers adapted quickly and incredibly well and I felt it was the only class I took this semester I actually got something out of. Keep doing what you're doing. 11/10</span><br />He was absolutely wonderful! One of my favorite instructors by far. His teaching style really helped me learn the material and have fun with it! I loved the video lectures with the little quiz questions included, this class was incredible and I will be recommending to all!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Awesome instructor. I would love to take another course with him.</span><br />He has a great personality and a good teaching style.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>&nbsp;Describe a concrete positive suggestion for how instruction can be improved. For example, something a different instructor does that works well.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I honestly loved him as a professor. I&iquest;m sad that I wasn&iquest;t able to have his class in person, but I can tell he loves what he does, and loves what he teaches. He is so understanding to student circumstances, and I can tell he truly cares about his student succeeding. He&iquest;s honestly a rare gem in the field of education. I truly love him as a professor.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">he is very in tune with his students and it helped so much</span><br />He does not need to improve anything. Very good professor.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">only 3 exams and a final instead of 5 exams total</span><br />having a class meeting time maybe once a week<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Maybe the instructor could include more fun, informative videos to break up lecture (examples of what we are learning); although, I feel I gained a lot throughout this course and thoroughly enjoyed it just the way it was.</span><br />Everything he did was amazing, I felt very supported as a student<br /><span style="color: #000000;">This class was asynchronous but I think we could've had an optional zoom review session before exams that allowed students to interact with the teacher and ask questions.</span><br />Adding more real-life examples would be pretty cool<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I really liked the way this course was presented! I do not have any suggestions.</span><br />I don't think there's anything else he could have done better. The class was great.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">If we have to return to virtual learning again, continue to teach the way that you have been! The course load was the right amount and the video quizzes and labs kept me engaged.</span><br />I have no suggestions<br /><span style="color: #000000;">There is nothing that needs to be improved!!!</span><br />I think more opportunity for discussion such as discussion posts would be okay to add, but not necessary.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">None, this course was 100% creative as well as informational.</span><br />Maybe add a place to put questions at the end of the lectures and then answer the questions students had in the next lecture video.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think this course was phenomenal! Only thing I think I would've found useful was a study guide before each test.</span><br />Not much can be improved from this class<br /><span style="color: #000000;">nothing</span><br />I ran into the problem more than once where I'd miss assignments because of the asynchronous class design combined with the fact that we didn't have a single set schedule for assignments, (ex: everything is due at the end of the week). It made it a bit harder to keep up with compared to other classes. I had no problems with any aspect of class except for the dates assignments were due being hard to keep track of. The same goes for exam days being differing days of the week and not announced at the beginning of the semester. It makes planning between other classes and work obligations harder.<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout this semester, I have really thrived when being able to discuss the course content with my peers. While discussions where one just has to post something &amp; respond to others might not be the most efficient use of time, maybe there could be some type of discussion incorporated into it, like having a few students create review quizzes for one chapter, and having them take each other's quizzes as review (and provide feedback).</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">More time in between lectures</span><br />This has been one of the best classes I have taken at UD, and it was solely because of the professor!<br /><span style="color: #000000;">Towards the end of the semester it became difficult to understand the broader ideas we talked about so maybe an overall schedule/guideline could be helpful for the future. Also a more laid out schedule for the class would be nice.</span><br />professor Rogers was very receptive to suggestions, so I do not have any further suggestions because all of the suggestions I made and concerns I voiced throughout the semester were addressed and actually implemented (adding videos without quiz to take notes prior to watching lecture, more examples included, always answered emails in a timely matter and was very kind)<br /><span style="color: #000000;">This instructor actually cared about his students. I never felt stranded in the course. Always responsive to email. Did not overload with busywork, everything was relevant and to the point.</span><br />Provide a bit more detailed syllabus.</span></p>
