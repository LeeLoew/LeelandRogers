    <p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong> TUESDAY 8/2 </strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Today we're continuing with a discussion about p-values/NHST along with a gentle introduction to correlations. We will also review some tricky questions from the last exam and the stats lab. I tried to make the video longer (based on some student feedback) but it broke everything and faced me to cut it into two videos. Sorry about the inconvenience, but I'm trying my best to improve things in any way that you all suggest in the feedback!</span></p>

    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;">WEDNESDAY 8/3</span></strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Today we'll be focused on working with the statistical software. After seeing how responses are coming in from the previous stats lab, I've decided we may want to include another one-sample stats lab for this week. I'm doing this for two reasons.</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Some people consistently made some mistakes in their responses</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">I want to make sure the questions are being phrased clearly.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This should give some of you another opportunity to update your understanding while earning some relatively easy points.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"> If you have any questions about that stats lab, or about these two stats labs- please reach out and ask! I want to be as helpful as possible in answering any of your questions. </span></span></p>

                <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Describe the benefits and drawbacks of NHST</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">How do you write out the null hypothesis?</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In sentence form (e.g., "College graduates do not have better emotion regulation skills than High School graduates"...not just something like "H<sub>0</sub> = 0")</span></li>

                <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">What is "p"- what probability does it represent?</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">How do people get this wrong sometimes? (potential opinion/creative question)</span></li>

                        <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Why do we choose alpha values and what are they used for?</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Why do we tend to choose alpha values such a 0.05, 0.01, etc.? Is this good practice? (potential opinion/creative question)</span></li>

            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Describe a slightly simpler way of thinking about what a p-values means (again, under the assumption that the null is true)</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What do we do once we compare our p-value to our alpha?</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Reject the null?</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Fail to Reject the null?</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why can't we say we "accept the null"?</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Statistical significance- what does it mean, exactly?</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What <em>doesn't</em> it mean? (potential option/creative question)</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Statistics can be hard- it is helpful you to <strong>write more in your answers</strong> to talk through your thinking. Many of you have gotten additional points or even full credit by talking through your thinking on questions-- this helps me see the effort your putting in and give as many points as possible!</span></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How would you write out an alternative hypothesis in sentence form?</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How does an alternative hypothesis dictate whether we're conducting a one-tailed or two-tailed test?</span></li>

                </li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">NHST often relies on several assumptions about the data-- what are some important assumptions made about data being used for a one-sample test?</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How does conducting a one-tailed vs two-tailed test change the part of the distribution we're interested in?</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How does the z-score(s) for the cutoff change?</span></li>

                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do we choose an alpha level before or after beginning a study/collecting/analyzing data?</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why is this an important thing to keep in mind? What are the consequences of not choosing an alpha before/after beginning a study/collecting/analyzing data? Are there ethical concerns? (potential open-ended creative question)</span></li>

    <p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"> <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><strong>Now that everybody has turned in their exam, today will be dedicated to reviewing the some potentially correct answers to the exam. The review video has been set to be optional (because I wouldn't want to force anybody who is comfortable with the content to sit through the review video/quiz). However, I have included one additional video discussing the state of the class and what the end of the semester will look like. Please take a look for easy points (I'd rather you review the video for Exam 3 instead of worry about a lot of extra work). <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Also, I want to take your suggestions and input very seriously. On the last exam, I asked you what the most frustrating topic was (in your opinion) so far. I'm going to try to provide some fresh perspectives on old content to help solidify your understanding of the content while also gently introducing some new material. Hopefully this will allow you to feel more confident with the material (and not overburdened) before the final.</span></strong></span> </span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>TUESDAY 8/9</strong></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Today we have some light new material- effect sizes. We'll also touch on confidence intervals again eventually to tie them together with test statistics and effect sizes! I'm also including a brief multiple-choice assignment to help give some low-stakes examples of hypothesis generation.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong><span style="color: #34495e;"><span style="caret-color: #34495e;">THURSDAY 8/11 (last class)</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #34495e;">You will have until Friday night to complete the final (and all other materials). I cannot grant extensions beyond that time because grades are due to the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #34495e;">The final is untimed, and I'm posting the questions here (but will also email you a copy to complete and send back) This way, you won't have to worry about keeping a tab open while you work out your answers (and potentially disconnect causing submission issues).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #34495e;">Please keep in mind the following:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #34495e;">Grades are highly correlated with the length of an answer written/effort. I mentioned it before - it's easier for me to award points when you fully write out your thinking. Out of all of the exams, the final will be least kind to anybody who isn't thorough in answering the question. Sometimes I provide a length minimum (e.g., a paragraph = 5-6 sentences), but you should always consider writing more.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #34495e;">Many of you have requested the final not contain work with datasets. I'm happy to oblige this request, as everybody has done an excellent job in the stats labs. However, this means that some of the questions demand more effort in flexibly applying content that you've learned (i.e., increased effort).</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #34495e;">Some of you have reached out during exams/stats labs with questions- please remember I'm happy to field any questions you may have.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #34495e;">Be careful of plagiarism. There have been a number of plagiarism flags for similar content shared between student answers as well as answers that were pulled from online sources. If you're unsure you've paraphrased correctly, just cite it (APA style or not, it doesn't matter here). Second chances for simple plagiarism mistakes can't be given out on the final exam.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #34495e;">This has been copy+pasted directly onto the exam instructions to make sure nobody misses this information.</span></p>
<p>____________</p>
<p><strong>A friend of yours is confused about the difference between population parameters and sample statistics. They ask you a few questions. Answer their question in a way that could make sense to anybody (and not just somebody who's taken statistics).</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><span>What's the difference between population parameters and sample statistics?&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span>What is sampling error and what does it have to do with population parameters?</span></li>
    <li>I read a psychology research paper where they used a very small sample in their experiment (~6 people).&nbsp;
        <ul>
            <li>Is collecting small samples generally a good idea? (10 points)</li>
            <li>Why would it ever be acceptable to collect a sample this small,? (10 points - Note that the correct answer is not something like, "it is never acceptable". Assume that in very rare cases this may be acceptable. Creative/effortful answers are encouraged)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>____________</p>
<p><strong>The follow questions are designed to build off of each other.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe a population where the data are<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>heavily skewed<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(real or fictional). Be as creative/imaginative as you like.
        <ul>
            <li>(one paragraph minimum)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Suppose you take a 20-person sample from the population you described. You calculated the mean of that sample. (multiple choice question)
        <ul>
            <li>Then, you took another 100 samples and calculated the means for each of those samples.</li>
            <li>The distribution of all of those means would be....</li>
            <li>(hint: central limit theorem)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Suppose you take a sample from the population you described to test a hypothesis.</p>
        <p>Be creative and make up a hypothesis (i.e., alternative hypothesis) for which you would conduct a one-sample test.</p>
        <p>(one/two sentences)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Now state the null hypothesis for the alternative hypothesis you came up with.</p>
        <p>(one sentence- refer to the brief hypothesis-generation quiz if you need to)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Upon conducting a one sample t-test, you find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>p</em><span>&nbsp;</span>= .047.</p>
        <p><strong>If the null hypothesis was actually true</strong>, what percentage of the time would you expect a sample like the one you collected?</p>
        <p>(just write the %)</p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Why would a heavily skewed population like the one you described be a problem for the one-sample t-test we covered (or oftentimes NHST in general).</span></li>
    <li><span>Thank you for a great semester. This question will be used to apply a curve to the final. Feel free to write whatever you like.</span></li>
