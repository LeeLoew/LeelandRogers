<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">incredible professor! really makes students feel supported and like they have room to creatively think and really expand their knowledge<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">He is simply amazing, willing to help all students, and could not do a better job of explaining the material and creating a clear understanding of it with the students.</span><br />He was amazing! Very accommodating and wanted his students to succeed.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Lee was a great professor and always answered any questions and gave opportunities to improve their grade and their learning</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">very nice fast responses and very accommodating one of the best professors I've ever had</span><br />Professor Rogers went above and beyond with the online format. I learned a lot and it was interactive but never overwhelming. More professors should set up their course as he does.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Easily the best professor I have had at the University of Delaware. The professor goes above and beyond to ensure students feel comfortable and welcome in the course. They have normalized difficulties with online learning and continuously reminds us that they are flexible. They create spaces to offer feedback throughout the semester via exams, which is something I appreciate. Course content is very manageable. Asynchronous lecture videos are short, to the point, engaging, and easy to understand. It is clear that a lot of effort has been put into assembling the lecture videos.</span><br />This professor focused on teaching how to understand and actually learn the material instead of us being graded on memorization, which most professors do.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">He was very understanding about the stress levels of a course, let alone an online semi-math-based course. He always left personalized video comments on quiz submissions and was very good about receiving feedback.</span><br />I really appreciated how this professor was very considerate of us students and the current situation we're living, due to COVID. He was always making sure that we didn't get too overwhelmed and considered our other classes when assigning work and exams. He was also flexible with due dates, if we had an issue and weren't able to turn something in on the due date, he gave extensions (when needed of course). He really wanted to see everyone succeed and that is something I don't see often with professors. Overall, I really enjoyed having this instructor and would consider taking another course with them.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I thought our professor was incredibly understanding and accommodating to students during this semester. Although not likely, if possible I'd love to take another one of his classes.</span><br />I absolutely will be on the SEARCH for any other courses taught by Leeland Rogers. Not only does he care more about our classes understanding of content than taking off dumb points for formatting errors etc, but he cares even more about the students. He made sure that everyone was doing okay even in this online format, I can't imagine how great he is in person!! More classes with Lee please!!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Everything he did was organized, clear, and the opposite of stressful. He was mindful of our attention spans and therefor kept his lecture videos short, even if he had to make more than one to cover a topic. During those videos he used multiple questions whether they were to follow the material or even to just bring our attention back to the video and it was extremely helpful in tracking my own attentiveness. For example, if I had found myself losing track, the question would pop up, and even if it wasn't a direct material question I would realize that I needed to rewind because I didn't hear what was said. On top of this, his videos were all very calm and consistent. He used relatable humor every now and then, even during quizzes (such as silly answer options) in a successful attempt to lighten the stress of hyperfocusing on the fact that we were taking a quiz. He was also extremely flexible with the scheduling. I do understand that other professors may be resistant to this teaching style based on their own experiences, however, in this day and age (and I don't just mean COVID) the teaching strategies he used were progressive and inclusive. This is what I believe it would take for more students to be doing better in general. This was a realistic approach to modernized teaching methods and it was such a relief to be taking his class. At no point in the semester did I feel overwhelmed by his coursework, by him directly, nor did I feel as though I couldn't reach out to him if necessary. I highly recommend his teaching methods be spread to the other professors as much as possible. I thank him for this experience because it gives me more drive to continue to pursue my education in comparison to other courses that cause me extreme stress at home when also trying to work to take care of my family and pay my bills. I have been waiting all semester to make this review. Thank you.</span><br />I appreciated how much he wanted us to well and fully understand the material to be able to apply it in our future pathways<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The instructor was very understanding given the difficult circumstances. Was always happy to help any student who needed it.</span><br />I really like this course! Thank you so much for your great course content!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I opted to take another class with Professor Rogers next semester because of his dedication to his students. I cannot express enough my satisfaction with this course- and I hate math so it is a big deal. One of the most noteworthy actions taken by Professor Rogers was his feedback; he recorded individual videos for each student regarding their performance on each assignment. Some of my professors did not even provide feedback on assignments so honestly, I was mindblown to receive individual videos praising us for hard work, explaining what to touch up on, and providing individualized comments on certain questions. Secondly, Professor Rogers created a very inclusive space and often spoke about social issues and his intentions to make everyone feel comfortable in his course. Also, he explained that because of the challenges covid is putting on students and families he wanted to be flexible with deadlines and that we could speak to him directly if extensions were needed. I never had to ask for an extension on anything, but it felt good to know I had that option if I needed it. Professor Rogers is truly an asset to the University and the students. I love seeing a passion for teaching in my professors and this was so apparent in this class. I felt valued and I felt that my work meant something and it was not just busy work.</span><br />Lee was a great professor, he makes everything very clear to understand. Lee was also understanding when it came to needing an extension or if you needed any extra help he always would give some extra explanations. I would highly recommend taking any of Lee's courses, I think he makes the most challenging topics very easy and I trust that I'd learn a lot from him in any class whether on zoom or not.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I can't say it enough how much I appreciated the effort to make this class low stress. As a pre-med my core classes are inherently very difficult and the professors make no effort to be accommodating. They make sure we understand the expectations, but then we're on our own so I really do appreciate the understanding you've shown us, I could tell you truly cared about our mental and emotional health and wanted to help however you could so thank you</span><br />I wish I could take you for another class<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Best class ever</span><br />- this professor was so considerate to all students. he made the class engaging with the built-in quizzes<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Lee was a great professor and catered to all of the students' needs. I really appreciated that each of the lectures were very specific and always covered the necessary material in a way that was easy to understand.</span><br />Professor Rogers is the best instructor I have had so far at UD! I am hoping to be moved off of the waitlist for his Cognition course in the fall. I would take every PSYC course with him if I could!<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I absolutely loved Professor Rogers. I will definitely be taking any other classes he is offering. He was so understanding and helpful of my situation and made a very difficult class super easy and engaging. The integrated quizzes he provided were my favorite way to learn this so far online and I highly suggest other professors doing this as well. Not only does it make you pay attention, it helps boost your grade with easy points and makes sure you understand the material. Overall, I absolutely loved having him as a professor and will recommend him everyone.</span><br />This instructor was probably the best I have ever had for a course in general. He was very flexible, made learning fun, and always praised/complimented his students at all times. I am not good at math and I strongly dislike math in general, but this course was definitely enjoyable, <span style="color: #7e8c8d;">thank you!! xx</span><br />Professor Rogers is amazing. He made this course so interesting and stress free, I would take it again in a heart beat. I'm so happy I had him as a professor.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Professor Rogers is the most understanding professor I have taken a class with at UD. Not only does he do everything he can to assist students and help meet their needs, but he does an excellent job making the material understandable and valuable.</span><br />Such a great professor! So caring about his students and made a class that I was nervous for very enjoyable and easy to get through! would recommend him to any other student taking PSYC209.<br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Leeland Rogers is a very kind very intelligent man who clearly cares deeply for his students. He always put our well being and concerns as a very high priority. Also his video quality was very high and much better then any of my other classes. Roger is the only professor I have had that made a video comment on my exam and clearly showed he read my exam and wanted to give real feedback. He is an incredible professor.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Essay Question #2: Describe a concrete positive suggestion for how instruction can be improved. For example, something a different instructor does that works well.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Literally nothing can be improved. I have had professor Rogers for two semesters now in two different classes and I feel I have learned the most in both of his classes.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">n/a</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Offer different times to meet on zoom for questions</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">no suggestions, class was run very well</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Give extra stats labs for practice and not necessarily for grades</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Not applicable</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I have no ideas, course was great.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I know it's not very helpful but I think everything was done really well. If anything, I would be asking other instructors to be as patient as this one was.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Giving outlines for exams with information on what we can expect to see and things we should know in order to prepare</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I enjoyed each lecture video, but I think I personally would have preferred for just one large video, instead of two small ones. I understand that canvas as limitations so if that was not possible, it's no biggie.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">Videos explaining feedback on exams</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">The only suggestion I can think of is having a syllabus with guiding dates for our assignments and due dates. Though I know this can be restricting to our class schedule, it would help with making sure I have planned around it for my other courses.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I actually wish I had the money to hire him as a private tutor. I would be doing better in all of my classes if they presented the material in his way. The only suggestion for improvement I would have is to increase the speaking volume during the videos he recorded.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I liked how the quizzes were integrated into the lecture videos</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">More discussion posts to increase interactivity with other students</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I think the course was perfect!</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I loved this class, and I do not have any suggestions to improve it- I learned so much, and Professor Rogers was amazing and extremely dedicated to the students.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">I don't have any improvements, this professor made such a challenging topic easy and comprehendible to understand. I feel very lucky to of had such a great professor for such a hard topic.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">ONly thing I would suggest is making lectures longer and posted in chunks instead of day by day. This is a personal preference, but I do prefer to sit down and do everything for one class all at once instead of waiting two days for part 2.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">None because he's the best professor I've had.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">The lectures were very easily understood</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">- maybe one suggestion could be to specify a bit more on how much we should write for all exams</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">I think that extra practice material with the statistical software that we have been using would be very beneficial.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Adding more discussion-based assignments, such as the discussion board feature on Canvas, could allow for more communication with peers on thoughts and ideas.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">No other suggestions. He was by far one of my favorite, if not my favorite, instructor I have ever had and made a difficult subject much easier to follow.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">N/A; This class was great.</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">N/A</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Before exams, have a review video and study guide!</span><br /><span style="color: #7e8c8d;">This class was incredible. Perhaps the only recommendation I would have is to have a few more labs involving the Jamovi. I would have loved to learn how to better use the software with more complex situations.</span></p>
